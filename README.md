## Project Overview 

This project develops a machine learning algorithm to predict heathcare insurance charges based on key personal features.

These features are the following: 
- Age
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Number of Children
- Sex
- Smoker Status
- Region

The goal of this model is to provide individuals with insights into their healthcare insurance costs and identify lifestyle factors that impact their charges. This model can then help users estimate if their insurance charges are resonable and explore potential ways to reduce their costs. 

The model uses Random Forest Regression for prediction.

# Healthcare Charge Predictor

## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict healthcare insurance charges based on personal features such as age, BMI, number of children, sex, smoking status, and region. The goal is to help individuals understand the factors affecting their insurance costs and identify actionable lifestyle changes (e.g., quitting smoking, lowering BMI) to potentially reduce these charges.

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle ([Healthcare Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/healthcare-insurance)).

The model uses Random Forest Regressor for prediction, as it showed the best performance with an RÂ² score of 0.9743 on testing data.
